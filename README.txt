SiTiDiUI is a Simple Timing Diagram generator, using a GUI.
It is written in Python, using the PySimpleGUI module.

At the moment this is a very basic program but fully functional.
The user can click on a timing line and rotate through options of
Low logic level, high level, rising edge and falling edge.

If a high logic level is chosen between a rising edge and falling
edge, then the whole stretch is flipped high. Conversely, if a low
level is selected between a falling edge and rising edge, then the
whole stretch is flipped low.

The units and tick marks on the x axis can changed, the number of
timing lines can be set (1 to 6) and a short title can be given for
each line (click on the default title).
